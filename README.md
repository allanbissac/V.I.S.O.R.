# V.I.S.O.R. (Visual Intelligent System for Object detection and Retrieval)

The robotic platform is based on the Leo Rover 1.8 platform. Features Elephant Robotics MyCobot 280 manipulator for grasping objects, Intel RealSense D435 depth camera for object detection and RPLIDAR A2M12 unit for mapping and navigation.
